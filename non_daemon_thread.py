"""
- For non-daemon threads, the program will wait till these threads are done at the end of the program before exiting
- Specifically, at the end of the program, there will be a call .join() for the non-daemon alive threads. 
- This is a blocking call that awaits completion of the thread.
    - If you look at the source for Python threading, youâ€™ll see that threading._shutdown() walks through all of the
    running threads and calls .join() on every one that does not have the daemon flag set.
- Experiment:
    - thread1.start(), thread2.start(), end prog
    - thread1.start(), thread1.join(). thread2.start() end prog
    - Compare the two, at the end of the program, join will be called implicitly, so we omit the necessary ones
- Result:
    - Case 1 -> concurrency
    - Case 2 -> One after another
