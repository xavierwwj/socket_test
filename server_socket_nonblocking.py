    Purpose of select: to check for readiness so that any
    following calls that may usually need blocking are guaranteed
    to not need them, thus allowing us to use nonblocking mode.
    For sockets, readiness comes in different forms i.e. one
    of the following.
    """
    """
    A socket becomes ready for reading when someone connects 
    after a call to listen (which means that accept wonâ€™t
    block), when data arrives from the remote end, or when 
    the socket is closed or reset (in this case, recv will 
    return an empty string).

    A socket becomes ready for writing when the connection 
    is established after a non-blocking call to connect or 
    when data can be written to the socket.

    A socket signals an error condition when the connection 
    fails after a non-blocking call to connect.

    The optional timeout argument specifies a time-out as a 
    floating point number in seconds. When the timeout 
    argument is omitted the function blocks until at least 
    one file descriptor is ready.

    This will be the time at which the connection request
    was sent. Prior to that, select was blocking the thread
    as the socket was not ready to be read. Only when 
    connection request is here, is the socket deemed ready
    i.e. guaranteed to not need blocking.

    Commenting the entire chunk below will result in the
    loop printing the time infinitely, because the socket
    is ready after the first connection, but accept was
    not run yet.
